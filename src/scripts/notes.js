// Given a user wants access Taksimplicity
// When a opens the application
// Then the user should see a welcome message
    // landing page? Welcome message in pop up or just on page? **definitely click button to get to form** 
// And see a form to input a username and password
    // after button click, populates on page
// And click an affordance to process the information
    // waiting screen? Probably not necessary

// Given a user enters their information
// When the user clicks the affordance
// Then the user should be taken to their personal account information
    // session storage and what not -- this is super neat
